# First Rally API

## Install (coming soon)

```
npm install firstrally
```

## Usage 

##### Require the package

```
FirstRally = require "firstrally"
```

You can use the API wrapper by calling the functions below. See `example.coffee` for a quick example.

## Authentication

All functions require authentication unless otherwise specified. Before you're able to call an authenticated function, you must first set your `api_key` and `api_key_secret`. If you don't set these correctly, you'll receive a 401 Unauthorized error response from the server.

##### Set your API key and Secret

```
FirstRally.set
  api_key: "... your api key ..."
  api_key_secret: "... your api key secret ..."
```

Both your api key and secret can be generated within your account page on [firstrally.com](http://firstrally.com)

## Real-time Data

Most users will want to use this API wrapper to subscribe to real-time data streams. First Rally monitors hundreds of streams from dozens of exchanges. Streams are identified using the following naming scheme:

```
exchange_id/base_currency/secondary_currency
```

An example stream id would be "coinbase_exchange/usd/btc". This would denote a data stream tracking the value of Bitcoin in U.S. Dollars on Coinbase Exchange. You can list all available data streams by performing the following:

```
FirstRally.DataStream.list (error, json) ->
  if !error?
    console.log json # list all streams
```

See DataStream.list below for detailed information about the response. 

## Historical Data

In addition to real-time data, you can use our API to make requests for historical data. Historical data is requested in batches, which when processed will produce a data file for download. Batch requests are specified by a `stream_id`, as well as the `start_date` and `end_date` representing the timespan of the resultant data. You can request a batch file via the following:

```
moment = require "moment"

FirstRally.DataBatch.create "coinbase/usd/btc", moment().subtract(1, "day"), moment(), (error, body) ->
  if !error?
    # body contains a batch_file_id which you can then check the status of the data batch,
    # and download the file if the batch succeeded in processing.
```

**CAUTION:** Requesting a data batch will subtract the price of that data batch from your account when successfully processed. Currently there is no mechanism to provide you a price quote via the API before accepting the charge, so call this function at your own risk. You will receive an error response from the server if your account does not have enough available credit. 

To download a successfully processed batch file, perform the following: 

```
fs = require "fs"

batch_file_id = 23 # assume the batch file id is 23

FirstRally.BatchFile.download batch_file_id, (error, stream) ->
  if !error?
    out = fs.createWriteStream("data_file.json.tar.gz")
    stream.pipe(out)
```

TODO: The above hasn’t been implemented yet.

## API Methods

* User.update_profile
* User.change_password
* User.login
* Notification.create
* Notification.delete
* DataStream.list
* DataStream.subscribe
* DataStream.unsubscribe
* DataBatch.create
* BatchFile.download

Each method takes a `done` parameter as the last argument. This is a callback function of the form `function(error, responseBody)` which you can use to process the response. If error is `null`, your response was successful. See the section **Handling Errors** below for more information about error handling.

### User

##### update_profile(profile, done)

Update your user's profile. Profile should be an javascript `object` with the following keys:

* `first_name`: `String`, the first name of your user.
* `last_name`: `String`, the last name of your user.
* `email`: `String`, the email of
* `password`: `String`, your user's current password. You cannot use this method to update your password, see **`change_password`** However, your password is required for security reasons. 

##### change_password(new_password, current_password, done)

Change the password for your user. Parameters are:

* `new_password`: `String`, the new password for your user.
* `current_password`: `String`, the current password of your user, required for security reasons.

##### login(email, password, done)

Log in as the user specified by the email and password. This will set a cookie that, if passed with all other requests, can be used instead of api key authentication. 

* `email`: `String`, the registered email for your user.
* `password`: `String`, your user's password.

### Notification

##### create(stream_id, price, direction, done)

Create a new notification for your user across the specified `stream_id` and the given price. 

* `stream_id`: `String`. Stream ids are in the form `exchange/first_currency/second_currency`, and they specify the exchange and the currencies being traded. A stream_id of `coinbase_exchange/usd/btc`, for instance, will denote the value of Bitcoin in U.S. Dollars on Coinbase Exchange.
* `price`: `Float`, the value that, when crossed in the direction specified by `direction`, will cause the notification to be sent. Note that this price is the same currency as `first_currency`.
* `direction`: `String`, one of [`above`, `below`, `crosses`], default `crosses`. If `above`, the notification will be sent when the price of the specified stream goes above the value listed in `price`. If `below`, the notification will be sent if the price has gone below `price`. If `crosses`, the notification will be sent regardless of direction.

Returns: JSON object representing the notification created, including `id`.

##### delete(notification_id, done)

Delete the notification specified by `notification_id`.

* `notification_id`: `Integer`, the id of the notification to delete.

### DataStream

##### list(done) *: Does Not Require Authentication*

List all data streams. Takes no parameters.

Output is similar to the following. Notice that the top-most keys are the exchange ids, whose objects contain a label and an `streams` object that lists the streams. The keys within each exchange’s `streams` object are the stream ids (used by the real-time data and historical data APIs), and the values are an object containing data about the stream.

All streams will contain a `primary_currency_code` -- often called the “base currency” -- and a `secondary_currency_code`, which is the currency being traded. Some streams, like Cryptsy, have other information provided by the exchange, but that information is not guaranteed across all exchanges and streams.

```
{
  "bitx": {
    "label": "BitX",
    "streams": {
      "bitx/zar/btc": {
        "primary_currency_code": "ZAR",
        "secondary_currency_code": "BTC"
      }
    }
  },
  "cryptsy": {
    "label": "Cryptsy",
    "streams": {
      "cryptsy/btc/42": {
        "primary_currency_name": "BitCoin",
        "primary_currency_code": "BTC",
        "secondary_currency_name": "42Coin",
        "secondary_currency_code": "42"
      },
      "cryptsy/btc/ac": {
        "primary_currency_name": "BitCoin",
        "primary_currency_code": "BTC",
        "secondary_currency_name": "AsiaCoin",
        "secondary_currency_code": "AC"
      },
      # All of the Cryptsy streams...
    }
  },
  # All the other exchanges...
}
```

##### subscribe(stream_id, callbacks)

Subscribe to a data stream.

* `stream_id`: `String`. Stream ids are in the form `exchange/first_currency/second_currency`, and they specify the exchange and the currencies being traded. A stream_id of `coinbase_exchange/usd/btc`, for instance, will denote the value of Bitcoin in U.S. Dollars on Coinbase Exchange.
* `callbacks`: `Object`, an object that contains callback functions for specific events. Currently, two events/functions are supported: `message`, `subscribe`. The `message` function will be called every time new data has arrived from the stream; the `subscribe` function will be called when the subscription is successful.

Example use of this function: 

```
FirstRally.DataStream.subscribe "coinbase/usd/btc", 
  message: (messsage) ->
    console.log "Message received on #{message.identifier}, sent at #{new Date(message.date)}. Price = #{message.value}"
  subscribe: () ->
    console.log "Successfully subscribed to coinbase/usd/btc!"
```

##### unsubscribe(stream_id) 

Unsubscribe from messages on a specific stream. This will prevent listening for new price events across the stream, and you’ll need to re-subscribe to that stream to begin receiving messages again.

* `stream_id`: `String`. Stream ids are in the form `exchange/first_currency/second_currency`, and they specify the exchange and the currencies being traded. A stream_id of `coinbase_exchange/usd/btc`, for instance, will denote the value of Bitcoin in U.S. Dollars on Coinbase Exchange.

### DataBatch

##### create(stream_id, start_date, end_date, done)

Request a set of historical data. This logs your request in our system *only*. Once we process your request, a batch file will be available for download.

* `stream_id`: `String`. Stream ids are in the form `exchange/first_currency/second_currency`, and they specify the exchange and the currencies being traded. A stream_id of `coinbase_exchange/usd/btc`, for instance, will denote the value of Bitcoin in U.S. Dollars on Coinbase Exchange.
* `start_date`: `Date`, the date specifying the lower bound of data to be included in the resultant batch file.
* `end_date`: `Date`, the date specifying the upper bound of data to be included in the resultant batch file.

### BatchFile

##### download(batch_file_id, done)

Download the batch file specified by `batch_file_id`.

* `batch_file_id`: `Integer`, the id of the batch file to download.
